* Objectives of demo application
 + Enclave remote attestation demonstration
 + Enclave communication to host demonstration
 + Trusted enclave communication over-the-wire facilitated by host

* Design
** Layout
 + Client is connected over network to Server
 + Server runs Calculator
** Remote host "Client"
 + Trusted entity
 + Requests creation of client enclave on the Server
 + Has verifier for enclave attestation
 + Has trusted computation it wants to do remotely
** Local host "Server"
 + Untrusted
 + Starts enclave app on demand from Client
 + Proxies/manages network connections of opaque encrypted communications
** Enclave app "Calculator"
 + Creates trusted channel with remote host
 + Receives data to compute on
 + Performs computation and sends back results


* Ideas for calculator
 + Simple incidence-of-word counts program
   - Given blob of text, counts occurances of given words in the text

* Channel
 + For now, the eapp will handle the secure channel. We will want to put this as a runtime feature later.
